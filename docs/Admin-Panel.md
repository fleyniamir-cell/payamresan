# Admin Panel

The Admin Panel provides a web-based interface for managing users, chats, runtime settings, and system operations. It's accessible to users with the **owner** or **admin** role.

## User Roles

- **Owner**: Full access to admin panel and all features
- **Admin**: Limited access to admin panel
- **User**: Regular user with no admin access

:::warning

Only one user with owner role can exist at a time.

:::

## Accessing the Admin Panel

1. Create or edit a user and give them the **owner** or **admin** role (prompted on fresh install, or later via the the [Deployment Script](./Deployment-Script.md)):

  ```bash
  songbird-deploy
  # Navigate to "Manage Database" submenu
  # Select "Create user" or "Edit user"
  # Follow prompts and select either "owner" or "admin" role
  ```
  :::info You can also use [database commands](./Database-Commands.md) if you prefer:

   ```bash
   cd /opt/songbird/server
   # If you want to create a new user
   npm run db:user:create
   # Or if you want to promote a user
   npm run db:user:edit
   # Follow prompts and select either "owner" or "admin" role
   ```
  :::

## Disabling the Admin Panel

To completely disable the admin panel:

```bash
# In .env
ADMIN_PANEL=false
```

When disabled:
- Admin button hidden from UI
- Admin API endpoints return 403
- Existing owner and admin accounts remain but cannot access panel

## Security Notes

- Admin API uses a separate authentication token (`ADMIN_API_TOKEN`)
- Auto-generated on first run and saved to `.env`
- Admin endpoints are localhost-only by design
- All admin actions are logged for audit trail
- Rate limiting applies (1000 req/15min as of v0.11.1)

## CLI Alternative

Most admin operations can still be performed via CLI:

```bash
cd /opt/songbird/server

# User management
npm run db:user:create
npm run db:user:edit
npm run db:user:delete
npm run db:user:ban

# Chat management
npm run db:chat:create
npm run db:chat:edit
npm run db:chat:delete

# Database operations
npm run db:backup
npm run db:restore
npm run db:vacuum
npm run db:inspect
```

See [Database Commands](./Database-Commands.md) for full CLI reference.
